This is my first try building something in GraphQL.

In this simple app You can run Apollo Server with graphQL type definitions and resolvers.

You have queries for products and categories as well as queries for filtering single product or category.

You can also display relations 1 to many and also many to 1.

App also has nodemon as a dependency so You don't have to stop you server everytime you make a change but it has hot reload in it.

After cloning this repo jsut run npm install to install all the dependencies and after that you can run npm start.
